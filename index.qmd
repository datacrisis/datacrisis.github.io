Hello there! 👋🏻

My name is Keifer Lee, a MS student @ New York University for the moment.

I'm originally from tropical Malaysia, where the people are varied and tasty foods are aplenty; while 🥯 bagels  are great, [Malaysian cuisines](https://migrationology.com/travel-destinations/malaysia-food-guide/) will always have a special place in my heart! 

I also dabble in research as a Graduate Student Researcher at the [AI4CE Lab](https://ai4ce.github.io) @ New York University, working with Professor Chen Feng primarily on Robotic Perception and Novel View Synthesis. In the past, I had a blast working on Autonomous UAVs with Dr. Swee King Phang at Taylor's University as an undergraduate (good ol' times!). As a side quest 🗡, I've been exploring the realm of LLMs in my spare time.

In terms of professional work, I was a Data Scientist @ MoneyLion for two exciting years (>$1B served annually) as part of the (amazing) Instacash team, and I had a blast this summer serving as a Data Science Intern at IBM's Chief Analytics Office (go CAO! 🇺🇸).

I'll also be serving as a Teaching Assistant for the graduate Robot Perception (ROB-GY 6203) course for Fall 2023. If you're taking the course, feel free to reach out!
