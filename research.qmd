This section is embarrassingly sparse as of now, please bear with me as I fill it up. If you would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out anytime and I'll try to revert back (almost) ASAP. 

My primary research interest can be summarized in this one sentence - <b><i>I want to research and develop robots to aid extraterrestrial exploration and colonization</b></i> (e.g. construction or exploration bots that will be widely use on Mars one day).

Though it sounds a bit far fetched, I think the idea has viable short-term commercial parallel as well! Also it may not be as far fetched upon further consideration since parties like SpaceX / NASA has been making great strides lately. ðŸš€

With the above idea in mind, the relevant tasks from an *applicative* point of view that I would like to tackle would be

1. <b>Exploration</b> - Efficient exploration, robotic planning and navigation, multi-modal perception, etc.
2. <b>Mapping</b> - Topological mapping, visual place recognition, neural mapping via NeRF (e.g. work like <a href=https://nerf-w.github.io>NeRF-in-the-wild</a> but with various constraints such as region-denial), etc. 
3. <b>Terraforming and Construction</b> - Multi-agent coordination and collaboration, Sim2Real to teach robots to perform new tasks in an adhoc manner via simulation and efficient learning via expert demonstration for learning on-the-fly, robotics for construction, etc

## Principled Approach Towards Optimal Neural Radiance Field Learning (Work in Progress)

An on-going research project I'm co-leading at the AI4CE Lab as of now. The title above is simply my own interpretation of a working title and will likely be subject to changes. 

Can't say much more for now, so stay tuned!

## Sim2Real for Robotic Manipulation

A collaboration project between the AI4CE Lab and an industry partner working in robotic systems and their applications. I couldn't say much since the actual project details are confidential unfortunately. However, we did manage to improve the baseline model's performance on key metrics tremendously via contrastive self-supervise approaches. 

So instead, look at this funny GIF I found.

## Monocular Target Tracking for Autonomous UAV

![Our test drone, Hornet-1 doing a fly-by to say "Hello!"](./resources/short_drone.gif)

**Abstract**<br>
My undergraduate project with the Taylor's Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Lab, Dr. Swee King Phang and Jun Jet Tai. The key objective is to develop an autonomous UAV capable of consistently track a given target during initialization. My main contributions are the development of a light-weight single target object-tracking algorithm that would be able of running at operational refresh rate (e.g. >30 FPS) on the light-weight single board computer.
