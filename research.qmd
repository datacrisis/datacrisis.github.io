This section is embarrassingly sparse as of now, please bear with me as I fill it up. If you would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out anytime and I'll try to revert back (almost) ASAP. 

My primary research interests lie in the following areas:

1. Machine Perception, Planning, and Navigation
2. Novel View Synthesis for Digital Asset Creation and World Building
3. Explainable and Attributable AI

## Principled Approach Towards Optimal Neural Radiance Field Learning (Work in Progress)

An on-going research project I'm co-leading at the AI4CE Lab as of now. The title above is simply my own interpretation of a working title and will likely be subject to changes. 

Can't say much more for now, so stay tuned!

## Sim2Real for Robotic Manipulation

A collaboration project between the AI4CE Lab and an industry partner working in robotic systems and their applications. I couldn't say much since the actual project is confidential unfortunately. However, we did manage to improve the baseline model's performance on key metrics tremendously via contrastive self-supervise approaches. 

So instead, look at this funny GIF I found.

## Monocular Target Tracking for Autonomous UAV

**Abstract**<br>
My undergraduate project with the Taylor's Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Lab, Dr. Swee King Phang and Jun Jet Tai. The key objective is to develop an autonomous UAV capable of consistently track a given target during initialization. My main contributions are the development of a light-weight single target object-tracking algorithm that would be able of running at operational refresh rate (e.g. >30 FPS) on the light-weight single board computer.
